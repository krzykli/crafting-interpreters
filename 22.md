At some memory cost, add a table storing name->index mapping for O(1)
retrieval?

Without a reasonable sized data set it might be difficult to say whether this
makes a difference.

Currently our array can hold only 256 locals, so perhaps it's not worth the added complexity?
Locals are allocated in one memory block, on 64bit machine this will take 24
bytes of space, total 24x256=6144bytes which will fit into L1 cache.

This code is does not make sense, the intent of the programmer was different.
What to do? compiler error if we can catch it at compile time, otherwise runtime error.
